This is a work-in-progress [course website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/) for Introductory Statistics for Undergraduate Students, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). Course covers a limited subset of topics from *Statistics for Business and Economics* (Anderson Sweeney Williams Camm Cochran 12e), and uses various definitions from the book. R (tidyverse) is used throughout.

Materials are written R in Jupyter notebook and shown as HTML files. To obtain codes and raw files, see [here](docs/gitsetup.md) for github set up. For HTML files, click on the links below.

# Dataset, Tables and Graphs

1. [An In-class Survey](survey/classsurvey.html)
  + create a tibble dataset
  + draw 10 random students from 50 and build a survey
2. [One Variable Graphs and Tables](descriptive/OneVariable.html)
  + frequency table
  + bar chart and histogram
  + R function and lapply to generate graphs/tables for different variables
3. [Multiple Variables Graphs and Tables](descriptive/MultipleVariables.html)
  + two-way frequency table
  + stacked bar chart
  + scatter-plot

# Summarizing Data

1. [Mean, Standard Deviation, Covariance, Correlation](summarystats/toolboxone.html)
  + a dataset with state-level wage and education data
  + scatter-plot
  + coefficient of variation rescales standard deviation
  + correlation rescales covariance
