This is a work-in-progress [course website](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/) for Introductory Statistics for Undergraduate Students, produced by [Fan](https://fanwangecon.github.io/). Course covers a limited subset of topics from *Statistics for Business and Economics* (Anderson Sweeney Williams Camm Cochran 12e). Book version: [bookdown site](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/bookdown) and [bookdown pdf](https://fanwangecon.github.io/Stat4Econ/bookdown/Introductory-Statistics-with-R-tidyverse.pdf).
