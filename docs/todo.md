Develop Several Key Course Components

## Normal Distribution and Standardizing the Normal Distribution

- plot several distributions, all normal, with different means and standard deviations.
- plot two distributions, standard normal and something not standard normal. Color bar indicating areas of the same size, and write down in formula what that implies

## Sample vs Population, many samples, and one population

Example 1, X percent people support in population

Samples vs Population.

Draw many samples, each sample is a survey. N surveys, What is he mean proportion of support in each survey.

Existing uniform to normal

1. have an example of binary (proportion) to normal
2. an example of continuous uinform to normal
3. what does the central limit theorem say exactly?

## Interval estimate and sampling distribution

What is the exact probably statement for confience interval

## Hypothesis testing various

Describe clearly the technical process to do testing, one sided, two sided, based on p-value or critical value.

The three possible cases:
1. know sd
2. don't know sd
3. proportion

for each, upper, lower, both tailed test

and within each, critical value and p-value approaches.

These could be three separate files for each overall case.

Graphs indicating p-value rejection zone
graphs indicating where critical value points are.
what are the rules for these.

Very technicall,

given some distribution,

1. Hypothesis test,

Test Score distribution, some process that generates test score, some true ability level, but there is some variance, so realized test score is a distribution depending on the shock at the moment. Suppose students are to proceed to next levels based on their true ability, but we only observe the test score, if the school wants to make sure that 95 percent of
