# Hypothesis Testing when the Population Variance is known

Following the central limit theorem, we know that the distribution of a sample mean follows the normal distribution. The mean and the standard deviation of the sampling distribution are known. 

## Left Tail Test

A school administrator needs to determine which students should fail. 


## Right Tail Test

Does drinking energy drink really improve test score?


## Two Tailed Test

$$
\mathrm{Cov}\left(x,y\right) = \sum_{a} \sum_{z} f(a,z) \cdot \left( x(a,z) - \mu_x \right) \cdot \left( y(a,z) - \mu_y \right)
$$
$$
\rho_{x,y} = \frac{\mathrm{Cov}\left(x,y\right)}{\sigma_x \cdot \sigma_y}
$$
From *sample*, we have the sample mean and sample size:

- $\bar{x} = 1$
- $n = 10$

From *Hypothesis*:

- $\mu_0 = 10$

Given that the *population* variance is:

- $\sigma_x = 2$
