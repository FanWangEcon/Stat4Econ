    "Often, we do not need to employ additional mathmatical tools, and can count directly  the number of experimental outcomes in a sample space.\n",

    "The school basketball team will play 5 games this season. The team can only win or lose for each game. If we only care about the number of wins/loses, then there are $5+1=6$ possible experimental outcomes: they win no games, 1 game, 2 games, 3 games, 4 games, and 5 games.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that in all the examples above, specifying the number of experimental outcomes does not tell us the probability that each outcome will be realized by. The dice could be weighted and the quarter could have a heavier side. Then knowing that there are 2 sides to a quarter and six sides to a dice does not tell us what the chance of getting each side is. The fact that there are four presidential candidate does not mean that each has $25$ percent chance of winning. A better basketball team would have higher chances of winning more games than a worse team, but the sample space of all possible experimental outcomes would be the same \n",

    "    + it could be that the quarter and dice are fair: if that is the case then the probability of getting each side of the dice is $\\frac{1}{6}$, and the probability of getting each side of quarter is $\\frac{1}{2}$.  In these cases, the probability that each experimental outcome happens is the same (uniform), and so the number of experimental outcomes is linked to the probability for each outcome.\n",
