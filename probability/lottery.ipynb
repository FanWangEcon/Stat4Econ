    "- What are the probabilities associated with each of the experimental outcomes?\n",

    "## Description of the Situation\n",
    "We are thinking about the problem from day zero perspective. We could play the lottery three times, on day one, day two and day three. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you can either win or lose when you play the lottery. Each lottery ticket costs the same. You will buy 1 lottery ticket on each day for three days straight. The chance of winning is the same for each lottery ticket (perhaps the number of people buying lottery is the same every day). You see at the end of each day whether you won or lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, what are the possible outcomes after three days? You are standing from the perspective of today, looking forward to what could happen tomorrow, two days from now, three days from now. Each day there are only two possible outcomes, but overall, you could have lost three times, won times times, lost once and won two times, etc. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Assumptions and Symbols\n",
    "\n",
    "*Assumptions*\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the descriptions above, we can write down the following assumptions we are making:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are $n$ numbers of identical lottery plays\n",
    "2. The outcomes of each lottery are always win or lose, just these two possible outcomes. \n",
    "3. The chance of winning each time, $p_{\\text{win}}$, is the same during each play. The chance of losing is the same as well, $1-p_{\\text{win}}$.\n",
    "4. Whether you won or not before does not before does not impact whether you will win in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Symbols we will use*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n$: denotes the number of lottery plays (number of trials)\n",
    "2. $x$: denotes the number of times you win, at most $x=n$, at least $x=0$, the number of losses is $n-x$\n",
    "3. $p$: the probability of winning, the probability of losing is therefore $1-p$.\n",

    "\n",
    "Generally, after $n$ trials/lotteries, if a particular experimental outcome had $x$ number of wins/successes (which means $n-x$ number of losses/failures), the probability that this particular experimental outcome happen is:\n",
    "$$ p^x \\cdot p^{n-x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities we wrote in the previous examples all follow this rule. Remember that if someone won every time, $n=x$, and we will have $p^{n-x}=p^0=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilities of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have discussed different experimental outcomes with unique sequences of wins and losses. In the 3 lottery example above, we have 8 experimental outcomes. If we are mainly interested in the total number of wins and losses, we can group these 8 experimental outcomes into 4 events. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Event win three times: W3 = $\\left\\{E_1\\right\\}$\n",
    "    $$P(W3)=p^{3} \\cdot (1-p)^{0}$$\n",
    "2. Event win two times: W2 = $\\left\\{E_2, E_3, E_5\\right\\}$\n",
    "    + Each of these three experimental outcomes' has P of happening is $p^{2} \\cdot (1-p)^{1}$, hence: $$P(W2) = 3 \\cdot p^{2} \\cdot (1-p)^{1}$$\n",
    "3. Event win one time: W1 = $\\left\\{E_4, E_6, E_7\\right\\}$\n",
    "    + Each of these three experimental outcomes' probability of happening is $p^{1} \\cdot (1-p)^{2}$, hence: $$P(W1) = 3 \\cdot p^{1} \\cdot (1-p)^{2}$$\n",
    "4. Event win zero time: W0 = $\\left\\{E_8\\right\\}$\n",
    "    $$P(W0)=p^{0} \\cdot (1-p)^{3}$$\n",

    "## Path\n",
    "- Each path is a different experimental outcome from day zero perspective. \n",
    "- Three paths have 2 wins and 1 loss\n",
    "- Three paths have 2 losses and 1 win\n",
    "- One path has three losses\n",
    "- One path has three wins\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The fact that along 3 of the paths, we have 2 wins and 1 loss does not mean the probability of getting two wins and one loss is $\\frac{3}{8}$. In our presidential election example, different candidates could win the election, those are like the paths here. The fact that we have four candidates does not mean the chance of each candidate winning is $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n",
