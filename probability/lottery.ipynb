    "- What are the probabilities associated with each of the experimental outcomes?\n",
    "- What are the gains and losses associated with each outcome\n",

    "\n",
    "## Description of the Situation\n",
    "We are thinking about the problem from day zero perspective. We could play the lottery three times, on day one, day two and day three. \n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you can either win or lose when you play the lottery. Each lottery ticket costs the same. You will buy 1 lottery ticket on each day for three days straight. The chance of winning is the same for each lottery ticket (perhaps the number of people buying lottery is the same every day). You see at the end of each day whether you won or lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question is, what are the possible outcomes after three days? You are standing from the perspective of today, looking forward to what could happen tomorrow, two days from now, three days from now. Each day there are only two possible outcomes, but overall, you could have lost three times, won times times, lost once and won two times, etc. \n",

    "*Assumptions*\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the descriptions above, we can write down the following assumptions we are making:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. There are $n$ numbers of identical lottery plays\n",
    "2. The outcomes of each lottery are always win or lose, just these two possible outcomes. \n",
    "3. The chance of winning each time, $p_{\\text{win}}$, is the same during each play. The chance of losing is the same as well, $1-p_{\\text{win}}$.\n",
    "4. Whether you won or not before does not before does not impact whether you will win in the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Symbols we will use*\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $n$: denotes the number of lottery plays (number of trials)\n",
    "2. $x$: denotes the number of times you win, at most $x=n$, at least $x=0$, the number of losses is $n-x$\n",
    "3. $p$: the probability of winning, the probability of losing is therefore $1-p$.\n",
