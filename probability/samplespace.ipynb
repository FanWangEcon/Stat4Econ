    "# Sample Space, Experimental Outcomes, Events, Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Basic Terms\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Experiment\n",
    "    - \"We define an experiment as a process that generates well-defined outcomes\" (ASWCC P171)\n",
    "2. Sample Space\n",
    "    - \"The sample space for an experiment is the set of all experimental outcomes\" (ASWCC P172)\n",
    "3. Experimental outcomes\n",
    "    - \"An experimental outcome is also called a sample point to identify it as an element of the sample space.\"\n",
    "4. Events\n",
    "    - \"An Event is a collection of Sample Points\" (AWSCC P181), could be just one sample point (one experimental outcome)\n",
    "5. Probability\n",
    "    - \"Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.\" (AWSCC P171)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Space and Experimental Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the letter $S$ or $\\Omega$ to denote sample space. More precisely:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supose we have a set of $n$ experimental outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\left\\{ E_1, E_2, ..., E_{n-1}, E_n\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call $S$ a sample space if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $E_i$ are mutually exclusive:\n",
    "    - $E_i$ for all $i$ are separate outcomes that do not overlap.\n",
    "    - Suppose there are multiple people running for the Presidency, some of these candidates are women, and some of these women are from Texas. If one of the $E_i$ is that a woman becomes the President, and another $E_i$ is that someone from Texas becomes the President, $S$ would not be a sample space, because we could have a woman who is also from Texas win the Presidency.\n",
    "2. $E_i$ are jointly exhaustive:\n",
    "    - For the experiment with well-defined outcomes, the $E_i$ in $S$ need to cover all possible outcomes. \n",
    "    - If you are throwing a six sided dice, there are six possible experimental outcomes, if $S$ only has five of them, it would not be a sample space.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assigning Probability to Experimental Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can assign probabilities to events of a sample space. Since experimental outcomes are themselves events as well, this means we can assign probabilities to the experimental outcomes in the sample space. \n",
    " For the mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive experimental outcomes of the sample space, there are tw$A^c$.\"equirements for assigning probabilities to th2. \n",
    "- Each element of the sample space can not have negative probability of happening, and also can not have more than $1$ probability of happening:\n",
    "    + $0 \\le P(E_i) \\le 1$, where $P$ denotes probability.\n",
    "- The probabilities of all the mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive experimental in the sample space sum up to $1$:\n",
    "    $$\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n} P(E_i) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Union and Intersection and Complements\n",
    "\n",
    "### Union, Intersection and Complements of Events\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Complement of Event $A$:\n",
    "    - \"Given an event A, the complement of A is defined to be the event consisting of all sample points that are not in A. The complement of A is denoted by $A^c$.\" (AWSCC P185)\n",
    "2. The Union of Events $A$ and $B$:\n",
    "    - \"The union of A and B is the event containing all sample points belonging to $A$ or $B$ or both. The union is denoted by $A \\cup B$.\" (AWSCC P186)\n",
    "3. The Intersection of Events $A$ and $B$:\n",
    "    - \"Given two events $A$ and $B$, the intersection of $A$ and $B$ is the event containing the sample points belonging to both $A$ and $B$. The intersection is denoted by $A \\cap B$.\" (AWSCC P187)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Probabilities for Complements and Union\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probabilities of Complements add up to 1:\n",
    "    $$P(A) + P(A^c) = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Addition Law**:\n",
    "    $$P (A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P (A \\cap B)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If two events $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, which means they do not share any experimental outcomes (sample points), then: $P (A \\cap B) = 0$, and $P (A \\cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Multiplication Law for Indepedent Events**:\n",
    "    $$P (A \\cap B) = P(A) \\cdot P(B)$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "If the probabiliyt of event $A$ happening does not change the probability of event $B$ happening, and vice-versa. The two events are independent.     \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a straight line to denote conditional probability. Given $A$ happens, what is the probability of $B$ happening?\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P (A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This says the probability of $A$ happening given that $B$ happens is equal to the ratio of probability that both $A$ and $B$ happen divdied by the probabilit of $B$ happening. \n",
    "\n",
    "If $A$ and $B$ are independent, that means the probability of $A$ happening does not change whether $B$ happens or not, then: $P (A | B) = P(A)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can apply the conditional probability formula to the tree diagrams.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",

    "\n",
    "### Presidential Election\n",
    "\n",
    "After various primaries there are four major candidates who could become president. Voting takes places in half a year. Over this year, many events could happen that would increase or decrease the support for candidates. After voting, the outcome is certain. But from today's perspective, when voting is one year from now, outcomes are uncertain. \n",

    "- Event: One could define many possible events. The experimental outcome is less than 3 is an event, greater than 2 is an event, been odd is an event, etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Following our definition for sample space above, we can actually define an alternative sample spaces, for example:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is also a sample space with two sample points (or experimental outcomes). Following our definitions earlier, these two experimental outcomes are mutually exclusive and jointly exhaustive. We could also call these two experimental outcomes here two different events of the sample space with the six sample points. \n",
