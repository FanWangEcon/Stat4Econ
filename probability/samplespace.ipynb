    "\n",
    "1. Experiment\n",
    "    - \"We define an experiment as a process that generates well-defined outcomes\" (ASWCC P171)\n",
    "2. Sample Space\n",
    "    - \"The sample space for an experiment is the set of all experimental outcomes\" (ASWCC P172)\n",
    "3. Experimental outcomes\n",
    "    - \"An experimental outcome is also called a sample point to identify it as an element of the sample space.\" (ASWCC P172)\n",
    "4. Events\n",
    "    - \"An Event is a collection of Sample Points\" (AWSCC P181), could be just one sample point (one experimental outcome)\n",
    "5. Probability\n",
    "    - \"Probability is a numerical measure of the likelihood that an event will occur.\" (AWSCC P171)"

    "## Sample Space and Experimental Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the letter $S$ or $\\Omega$ to denote sample space. Supose we have a set of $n$ experimental outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S = \\left\\{ E_1, E_2, ..., E_{n-1}, E_n\\right\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call $S$ a sample space if:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $E_i$ are mutually exclusive:\n",
    "    - $E_i$ for all $i$ are separate outcomes that do not overlap.\n",
    "    - Suppose there are multiple people running for the Presidency, some of these candidates are women, and some of these women are from Texas. If one of the $E_i$ is that a woman becomes the President, and another $E_i$ is that someone from Texas becomes the President, $S$ would not be a sample space, because we could have a woman who is also from Texas win the Presidency.\n",
    "2. $E_i$ are jointly exhaustive:\n",
    "    - For the experiment with well-defined outcomes, the $E_i$ in $S$ need to cover all possible outcomes. \n",
    "    - If you are throwing a six sided dice, there are six possible experimental outcomes, if $S$ only has five of them, it would not be a sample space.\n",
