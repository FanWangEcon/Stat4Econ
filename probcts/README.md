# How the Z table, Distribution Works Example
to go from p to z
and go from z to p
size of area in between.

# What does it mean to go from one normal to another normal?

two distributions, the sizes of two areas are the same, even though the x points are very different.

# Explain PDF vs CDF

pdf points, CDF area, show total area

# Various Distributions

Whatever code/examples I create above, should work with every single one of R's main distributional functions.

This should be a useful tool for researchers in general to learn about the features of different distributions.

Potentially Continuous Distributions
