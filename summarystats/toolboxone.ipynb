    "# Toolbox One\n",
    "\n",
    "We have various tools at our disposal to summarize variables and the relationship between variables. Imagine that we have multiple toolboxes. This is the first one. There are two levels to this toolbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Level\n",
    "\n",
    "On the first level, our three tools are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (sample) Mean of X (or Y)\n",
    "2. (sample) Standard Deviation of X (or Y)\n",
    "3. (sample) Covariance of X and Y\n",
    "\n",
    "## Second Level\n",
    "\n",
    "On the second level, we have two tools that combine the tools from the first level:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coefficient of Variation = (Standard Deviation)/(Mean)\n",
    "2. Correlation = (Covariance of X and Y)/((Standard Deviation of X)*(Standard Deviation of Y))\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools on the second level rescales the standard deviation and covariance statistics. \n",

    "Formulas are short-hands so that we can be precise and succient. \n",

    "Two variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Fraction of individual with college degree in a state\n",
    "    + this is in Fraction units, the minimum is 0.00, the maximum is 100 percent, which is 1.00\n",
    "2. Average hourly salary in the state\n",
    "    + this is in Dollar units\n",
    "\n",
    "The two variables above are in different units. We first calculate mean, standard deviation, and covariance. With just these, hard to compare the standard deviation of the two variables, which are in different scales. Also from covariance, hard to tell whether it is large or small. To make comparisons possible, we calculate coefficient of variations and correlation statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Deviations and Coefficient of Variation\n",
    "\n",
    "The sample standard deviations for the two variables are: $0.051$ and $1.51$, in fraction and dollar units. Can we say the hourly salary has a larger standard deviation? But it is just a different scale. $1.51$ is a large number, but that does not mean that variable has greater variation than the fraction with college education variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Converting the Statistics to Coefficient of Variations, now we have: $0.16$ and $0.09$. Because of the division, these are both in fraction units--standard deviations as a fraction of the mean. Now these are more comparable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Covariance and Correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "The covariance we get is positive: $0.06$, but is this actually large positive relationship? $0.06$ seems like a small number. \n",
    "\n",
    "Rescaling covariance to correlation, the correlation between the two variables is: $0.78$. Since the correlation of two variable is beloww $-1$ and $+1$, we can now say actually the two variables are very positively related. Higher share of individuals with college education is strongly positively correlated with higher hourly salary. "
